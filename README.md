# Business card page

The website is one of my first projects. It can be used as a business card page presenting a person's portfolio, interests and contact details.

Technologies used:
[![My Skills](https://skills.thijs.gg/icons?i=html,css)](https://skills.thijs.gg)

-   HTML
-   CSS

The website is fully responsive on both computer and smartphone screens. Images were taken from the web and I do not own them.
